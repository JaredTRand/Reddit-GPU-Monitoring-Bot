# Reddit-GPU-Monitoring-Bot
## Jared Rand

I made a bot that looks over a subreddit for deals on PC parts, and texts me whenever someone posts a GPU (Because I need to buy a new one)
I tried several ways to make it text a phone number, but I couldn't manage to get any to work, so I gave in and used Twilio.
(I did manage to make it email me just fine though.)
:D
